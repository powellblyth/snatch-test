# snatch test

This test contains a demonstration of unit testing, TDD development of a (slightly) crazy validation requirement,
methods to instantiate the environment (assuming docker exists), some .env examples and a laradock installation

## dev-up
the dev-up _should_ build the environment up

## runtests.sh 
This runs the unit test (s) in the project. There's only one, which is for demonstration purposes
I would expect more in a production project
